 - wh loader: when linking to LIMS data, for whole lane libraries
   disregard superfluous tag_index value in the iseq_flowcell table

release 42.10.0
 - load uqc outcomes to iseq_product_metrics table and use
   this value, if defined, to set the overall qc outcome
   for a product
 - load interop autoqc check results to iseq_run_lane_metrics table

release 42.9.0

     flag-driven upload of an empty manifest for external products

     a bug in counting the number of remote files is fixed

   name

     column mapping update,
     bug fixes for merged top-up data

release 41.6.1
 - recognise 'NA' string as a valid value for Fractional_NRD and
   NRD_pass report columns; meaning - the array data for that sample
   is not available
 - report what is being parsed

release 41.6.0
 - run data deletion from ml warehouse - bug fix
   (product rows for merged data were not deleted)
 - loader for an external report:
    deal with externally merged data and external QC data

 - script to load external report to ml warehouse

release 41.4.0
 - test data enhancement to ensure forward compatibility

release 41.3
 - run folders for test data restructured to reflect new-style
product hierarchy
 - bug fix for setting (or not) foreign keys on update

release 41.2.1
 - change lims_fk_repair flag default from false to true to
   mitigate code regression in release 41.2, which erases value of
   the foreign key into iseq_flowcelt table on subsequent runs of
   the loader for a particular run (is the foreign key is set
   correctly only if no data exist in the product table)

release 41.2
 - a new role - npg_warehouse::loader::product - consolidates
   methods for retrieving autoqc data for compositions and
   loading this data to the iseq_product_metrics table
 - a new script - npg_products2mlwarehouse - for loading product
   autoqc data to the iseq_product_metrics table

release 41.1
 - add target autosome stats to autoqc loader
 - correct retrieval of split and non-split data for bam_flagstats
     autoqc results

release 41.0
 - autoqc retriever:
     use special function for retrieval of ref_match result,
     do not process old contamination autoqc results for ml warehouse
 - wh loader changes following ml warehouse schema update in
   https://github.com/wtsi-npg/ml_warehouse/pull/10:
     update existing row instead of deleting and re-inserting them,
     on insert to product table create rows in the product components table,
     on product table row update do not assign LIMs fk values unless
     lims_fk_repair flag is true
 - a new script for back-populating product components table
 - a new script for deleting run data from ml warehouse

release 40.1
 - wh loader:
     add ability to load lanes that do not exists in tracking database,
     load autoqc data for all statuses (ie including 'data discarded'),
     push defined library outcomes from merged entities to single plexes
     if the library outcome for teh latter is not set

release 40.0
 - wh loader: refactor to accommodate loading results for
   multi-component entities
 - autoqc data retriever - stop retrieving data for the old split stats
   check which is only needed for the old warehouse
 - if multiple runs are loaded, load in the decreasing run id order
 - wh loader script - add a new option, num_runs, to load a limited
   number of latest runs
 - load instrument_side and workflow_type columns of the
   iseq_run_lane_metrics table
 - loadnrd_percent column of the iseq_product_metrics table

release 39.11
 - auto QC loader query costruction: do not use invalid option
 - wh loader: skip loading results for multi-component entities
 - to retrieve lane-level results for multi-component entities,
   ask for lanes and plexes separately
 - stop loading Illumina qc data that came from chached_query table
   of the npg_qc database (pf_cluster_count, raw_cluster_count, pf_bases)
 - load q30 and q40 yields from qX_yield autoqc check results     
 - load bam_flagstats target metrics into iseq_product_metrics table
 - a script to launch warehouse loader script for certain runs

release 39.10
 - two gbs metrics to be added to the iseq_product_metrics table

release 39.9
 - multiple RNA-related metrics to be loaded into iseq_product_metrics
   when updating the data warehouse
 - added support for NPG SeQC metric tables that only have composition
   and not id_run, position and tag_index columns such as rna_seqc
 - added tag_hops_percent and tag_hops_power

release 39.8
 - code and tests changed to enable finding QC outcomes via a linked composition
 - Travis builds might fail under Perl interpreters without support for threads,
   see wtsi-npg/npg_tracking#428 for details. Production code does not run
   under Perl 5.16, so removed Travis build for this Perl version

release 39.7
 - test data changes to ensure compatibility with npg_qc release 64.1

release 39.6
 - qc database fixtures additions to enable finding autoqc
     results via a linked composition

   factored out; a driver parent object is created

   a flowcell database record are missing
 - correct computation of expected abs path in test
 
release 39.4
 - correct computation of expected abs path in test

release 39.3

release 39.2
 - code changes to eliminate warnings when running under Perl 5.22.2
 - PDL return value is now dealt with withing autoqc result objects,
   the warehouse loader can rely on them being either a number
   or undefined
 - Travis CI testing added

  (see https://github.com/wtsi-npg/npg_qc/pull/342)

   identifier is provided.
 - daemon to continiously repair foreign keys from iseq_product_metrics
   table in ml warehouse to iseq_flowcell table

release 37.8
 - Load unexpected tag and chimeric fields in iseq_product_metric and 
   iseq_run_lane_metric tables

release 37.7
 - wh loader bug fix to prevent dropping existing product data if
   no new data is available (GCLP staging data not visible from seq farm
   and other way around)  

release 37.6.1
 - update/fix tests to comply with ml_warehouse v1.5 and npg_tracking v84.7 

release 37.6
 - delay wh loader till the run is finished so that we have time to
   update the number of lanes in the npg_tracking db

   Reverted to per-row insert.

release 37.5

 - use fast batch insert mode

release 37.4
 - fixed a bug in recognising an allowed error in lims data retrieval

release 37.3
 - ml_warehouse driver for st::api::lims
 - ml_warehouse loader - use common code for retrieving flowcell LIMs data from the database

release 37.2
 - loader changes resulting from dropping most of autoqc columns from the run lane metrics
   and removing from this table a foreign key into the flowcell table
 - give preference to batch_id when linking to the flowcell table
 - add explain flag for logging problems linking to tle flowcell table
 - link as much data as possible for a flowcell with duplicate entries
 - retrieve and load data for verify_bam_id check and for normal mode distribution
   in the insert size check

release 37.1
 - add run_is_indexed method to npg tracking data source

release 37.0
 - the following modules
     npg_warehouse::loader::autoqc
     npg_warehouse::loader::npg
     npg_warehouse::loader::qc
     npg_warehouse::loader::run_status
   were moved to this package from the SVN data-handling package (release 36.7).
 - npg_warehouse::loader::run_status module was changed to accomodate
     loading run statuses to the multi-lims (ml) schema defined in WTSI::DNAP::Warehouse::Schema
 - initial version of the module (npg_warehous::loade::run) for loading the analysis data to
     the ml warehouse
