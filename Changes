LIST OF CHANGES

 - wh loader: refactor to accommodate loading results for
   multi-component entities
 - autoqc data retriever - stop retrieving data for the old split stats
   check which is only needed for the old warehouse
 - if multiple runs are loaded, load in the decreasing run id order
 - wh loader script - add a new option, num_runs, to load a limited
   number of latest runs
 - load instrument_side and workflow_type columns of the
   iseq_run_lane_metrics table

release 39.11
 - auto QC loader query costruction: do not use invalid option
 - wh loader: skip loading results for multi-component entities
 - to retrieve lane-level results for multi-component entities,
   ask for lanes and plexes separately
 - stop loading Illumina qc data that came from chached_query table
   of the npg_qc database (pf_cluster_count, raw_cluster_count, pf_bases)
 - load q30 and q40 yields from qX_yield autoqc check results     
 - load bam_flagstats target metrics into iseq_product_metrics table
 - a script to launch warehouse loader script for certain runs

release 39.10
 - two gbs metrics to be added to the iseq_product_metrics table

release 39.9
 - multiple RNA-related metrics to be loaded into iseq_product_metrics
   when updating the data warehouse
 - added support for NPG SeQC metric tables that only have composition
   and not id_run, position and tag_index columns such as rna_seqc
 - added tag_hops_percent and tag_hops_power

release 39.8
 - code and tests changed to enable finding QC outcomes via a linked composition
 - Travis builds might fail under Perl interpreters without support for threads,
   see wtsi-npg/npg_tracking#428 for details. Production code does not run
   under Perl 5.16, so removed Travis build for this Perl version

release 39.7
 - test data changes to ensure compatibility with npg_qc release 64.1

release 39.6
 - qc database fixtures additions to enable finding autoqc
     results via a linked composition

release 39.5
 - to enforce business logic consistency, common parts of lims drivers
   factored out; a driver parent object is created
 - early failure with a clear error message when essential parts of
   a flowcell database record are missing
 - correct computation of expected abs path in test
 
release 39.4
 - correct computation of expected abs path in test

release 39.3
 - added iseq_run_lane_metrics.run_priority to warehouse update (from npg_tracking run.priority)

release 39.2
 - code changes to eliminate warnings when running under Perl 5.22.2
 - PDL return value is now dealt with withing autoqc result objects,
   the warehouse loader can rely on them being either a number
   or undefined
 - Travis CI testing added

release 39.1
 - compensate for loss of split_stats role in npg_qc
  (see https://github.com/wtsi-npg/npg_qc/pull/342)

release 39.0
 - added tests for 'purpose'
 - ml_warehouse lims driver refinments to ensure db connection is
   propagated
 - add run/flowcell level caching st:api:lims driver

release 38.0
 - autonomous ml_warehouse driver which takes query by run id
 - extended ml warehouse loader to load final qc values

release 37.10
 - Corrected calculation of unexpected_tags_percent

release 37.9
 - Try to figure out id_run from IseqProductMetrics if a flowcell
   identifier is provided.
 - daemon to continiously repair foreign keys from iseq_product_metrics
   table in ml warehouse to iseq_flowcell table

release 37.8
 - Load unexpected tag and chimeric fields in iseq_product_metric and 
   iseq_run_lane_metric tables

release 37.7
 - wh loader bug fix to prevent dropping existing product data if
   no new data is available (GCLP staging data not visible from seq farm
   and other way around)  

release 37.6.1
 - update/fix tests to comply with ml_warehouse v1.5 and npg_tracking v84.7 

release 37.6
 - delay wh loader till the run is finished so that we have time to
   update the number of lanes in the npg_tracking db

release 37.5.1
 - DBIx batch insert does not work correctly, leaves some columns empty.
   Reverted to per-row insert.

release 37.5
 - a utility for repairing unset foreign keys from npg product table to
   the flowcell table in the ml warehouse
 - minimise time tables are locked for when loading data to the warehouse
 - use fast batch insert mode

release 37.4
 - fixed a bug in recognising an allowed error in lims data retrieval

release 37.3
 - ml_warehouse driver for st::api::lims
 - ml_warehouse loader - use common code for retrieving flowcell LIMs data from the database

release 37.2
 - loader changes resulting from dropping most of autoqc columns from the run lane metrics
   and removing from this table a foreign key into the flowcell table
 - give preference to batch_id when linking to the flowcell table
 - add explain flag for logging problems linking to tle flowcell table
 - link as much data as possible for a flowcell with duplicate entries
 - retrieve and load data for verify_bam_id check and for normal mode distribution
   in the insert size check

release 37.1
 - add run_is_indexed method to npg tracking data source

release 37.0
 - the following modules
     npg_warehouse::loader::autoqc
     npg_warehouse::loader::npg
     npg_warehouse::loader::qc
     npg_warehouse::loader::run_status
   were moved to this package from the SVN data-handling package (release 36.7).
 - npg_warehouse::loader::run_status module was changed to accomodate
     loading run statuses to the multi-lims (ml) schema defined in WTSI::DNAP::Warehouse::Schema
 - initial version of the module (npg_warehous::loade::run) for loading the analysis data to
     the ml warehouse
 - initial version of scripts for loading run statuses and analysis data to the ml warehouse
