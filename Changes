LIST OF CHANGES

 - Added .github/dependabot.yml file to auto-update GitHub actions
 - GitHub CI - updated deprecated v2 runner action to v3
 - Following a release on 07/09/2024, see https://metacpan.org/dist/App-perlbrew/changes,
   the checksum of the script served by https://install.perlbrew.pl had changed.
   https://install.perlbrew.pl is a redirect to raw
   https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/blob/master/perlbrew-install, so
   the change originates from GitHub and can be trusted. Our CI flow compares
   the checksum of the downloaded script to the expected value. We now store
   an updated expected checksum value, which corresponds to the latest release.

release 51.0.0 (2024-07-25)
 - PacBio loader - include loading from 3 fields with changed names in
   SMRT Link output files
 - Remove a plugin for npg_tracking::daemon, which was used to demonise
   the npg_mlwarehouse_fkrepair script.

release 50.5.0 (2024-05-28)
 - Removing Tidyp dependency from CI
 - Minor change npg_warehouse::loader::pacbio::product to incorporate
   loading 1 new field.

release 50.4.0
 - PacBio - minor tweak to hifi yield values due to SMRT Link v13
 - Extend npg_warehouse::loader::pacbio::product to load metrics per (usually
   deplexed) product.

release 50.3.0
 - Minor change to Illumina product metrics loader to include extra metrics
   for BGE libraries.
 - Ensure that pull requests to the master branch source dependencies from
   master branches (devel branch was hardcoded).

release 50.2.0
 - Minor PacBio run loader tweak to avoid trying to parse garbage XML

release 50.1.0
 - Switch to Perlbrew to obtain multiple Perl versions

release 50.0.0
 - Change PacBio loader to support plate number for Revio runs.

release 49.0.0
 - Minor change to PacBio loader to find movie name from alternate source
   on ccs dataset if not in standard location on well.
 - Removed samplesheet daemon class

release 48.0.0
 - Removed all ml_warehouse lims drivers. Drivers moved to npg_tracking with
   associated tests and file history

release 47.1.0
 - PacBio loader is extended to load deplex stats where deplexing
   has been run on board the instrument

release 47.0.0
 - move get_tags method to ml_warehouse repo

release 46.10.0
 - add sl_ccs_uuid to the pacbio warehouse loader

release 46.9.2
 - Relaxed the 'required' constraint for two attributes in
   npg_warehouse::loader::pacbio::base. This is a short term solution to a
   problem elsewhere. The change allows for using classes that consume this
   role in the context of other packages.

release 46.9.1
 - Bug fix: resolved the discrepancy in the attribute name between the
   npg_pacbio_runs2mlwarehouse script and the npg_warehouse::loader::pacbio::run
   class.

release 46.9.0
 - PacBio loader is extended to load the outcomes from PacBio manual QC,
   see https://github.com/wtsi-npg/npg_langqc for information on the system
   that supports PacBio manual QC.

release 45.8.0
 - PacBio loader:
   - move tag sequence parsing into separate function,
   - generate well's product IDs only for new records,
   - prior to creating run product records, drop product records for runs
     where at least one product record is not linked to the pac_bio_run
     table; this ensures that product records are properly relinked.
 - drop the CI build dependency on npg_irods - the only package that was
   sourced from that repo - WTSI::NPG::HTS::PacBio::Sequel::APIClient -
   has been moved to https://github.com/wtsi-npg/perl-dnap-utilities

 - add autoqc substitution metrics to the iseq_product_metrics table

release 45.4.1
 - patched the loader for Illumina run parameters XML files so that
   it does not fail when the glob expression contains only the bracket
   expansion (this is what the pipeline passes to the script)

release 45.4.0
 - tweak to pacbio loader to deal with different SMRT Link versions
 - add a loader for Illumina run parameters XML files

   input data from multiple files residing in a common directory

   for sequencing products from different pipelines to ml warehouse

release 45.0.0
 - remove provisions for loading the old Sequencescape warehouse
   since the data is not longer loaded to that warehouse and the loader
   code has been removed, see
   https://github.com/wtsi-npg/npg_sequencescape_warehouse/pull/30

release 44.3.1
 - tag_index column is dropped from the tag_metrics table of the
   QC database - update test fixtures accordingly.

release 44.3.0
 - add npg_check_study_staging_location for use in cron to warn of
   studies not in expected staging areas

release 44.2.0

    - xxxxx#z.cram
    - xxxxx_y#z.cram
    - xxxxx_y-y#z.cram
 - add control metrics to pacbio loader
 - load data to new columns in the iseq_heron_metrics_table

release 44.1.0
 - inital ml warehouse run data loader for pacbio data
 - move from Travis CI to GitHub Actions

release 44.0.0
 - change table loading to include the new iseq_run table in ml_warehouse

 - a new flag --[no-]require_qc_complete for study manifest generation
   to suppress (default) or not the manifest generation for runs that
   do not have 'qc complete' as their current status

release 43.2.0
 - samplesheet generation for MiSeq instruments (both a script and a class)
   is moved to this package from npg_tracking, the class is renamed
   (npg::samplesheet::auto -> npg_tracking::daemon::samplesheet::auto); it is
   changed to use the ml_warehouse driver for LIMs data access

release 43.1.0
 - retrieval and loading of heron artic autoqc data is refactored
   to make the code more generic and flexible, in particular:
   1. when retrieving autoqc data, the data from all portable
      pipelines are stored under a single top-level key, thus
      making it easy to skip this data when loading non-pp tables
   2. if the same column names are used in pp and non-pp tables,
      preference is given to data from the generic result objects
   3. since in-memory data structure for the generic autoqc results
      is now more flexible, it becomes possible to accomodate
      multiple data sets, for example, storing ampliconstats data
      per entity per amplicon, rather than flattenning ampliconstats
      data 
 - retrieval of ampiconstats autoqc data and loading the data to the
   new iseq_product_ampliconstats table

 - wh loader: when linking to LIMS data, for whole lane libraries
   disregard superfluous tag_index value in the iseq_flowcell table

release 42.10.0
 - load uqc outcomes to iseq_product_metrics table and use
   this value, if defined, to set the overall qc outcome
   for a product

   mitigate code regression in release 41.2, which erases value of
   the foreign key into iseq_flowcelt table on subsequent runs of
   the loader for a particular run (is the foreign key is set
   correctly only if no data exist in the product table)

release 41.2
 - a new role - npg_warehouse::loader::product - consolidates

release 39.8
 - code and tests changed to enable finding QC outcomes via a linked composition
